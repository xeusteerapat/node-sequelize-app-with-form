# node-sequelize-app-with-form

I've followed tutorial from [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOHysWYMZM0) (there are 3 parts) Thank you for a great tutorial.

Brad have used `posgresql` but I've used `mysql` and also I've use `ejs` instead of `handlebar`

## Start app

- Clone this repo
- ```npm install```
- ```sequelize db:create```

## Todo

I plan to add some functionality in the future.

- Form validation
- Search Gig
